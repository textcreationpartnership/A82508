            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was not our purpoſe, when theſe <hi>Examinations</hi> of our Reverend and beloved <hi>Brother</hi> and neighbour came forth, to have made any <hi>Reply</hi> to them: Firſt, becauſe we thought there was that already publiſhed to the world on both ſides, which was more weighty then either the <hi>Examinations</hi> or <hi>Anſwer</hi> to them were like to be deemed. Secondly, becauſe we apprehended ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, rather called to this Work, then our ſelves; becauſe their <hi>Poſitions</hi> and <hi>Scriptures</hi> brought by them, are profeſſedly and <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally</hi> oppoſed, as the margent declares. Thirdly, becauſe we were unwilling to ingage our ſelves or others in the <hi>Controverſie,</hi> further then we ſhould be compelled; knowing it to be one evill under the Sun in <hi>men</hi> (and perhaps, <hi>in ſome good men</hi>) that they <hi>will ſtrive for Victory, rather then for Truth.</hi> And as it is with an unyeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſpirit, it will contend for the-laſt word: So it is in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of books, who ſhall Print laſt in his own Cauſe. We choſe therefore rather to practiſe in ſilence, according to our own light, and quietly to follow the Work we are called to in theſe parts, then to implead thoſe that ſhould plead againſt the Way we walk in. Therefore, when the <hi>Examinations</hi> firſt came down, though we read them, yet we minded not to anſwer them; for three moneths almoſt, the thoughts of intermedling in the Work (now effected by us) ſlept with us. At laſt we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened to conſider what was fit to be done by us. And after ſome conſultation, thought our ſelves bound to vindicate wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Scriptures, Poſitions, Perſons;</hi> that which bred a change in our mind, was: Firſt, an expectation and earneſt deſire in theſe parts, that ſomething might be anſwered thereunto, or the Cauſe yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Secondly, the eyes of many were upon us rather then upon others: Firſt, becauſe the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Examinations</hi> is our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
<pb facs="tcp:113298:3"/>Secondly, becauſe many of theſe things have been diſcuſſed betwixt him and us: Thirdly, becauſe it is thought that ſome of the <hi>Poſitions</hi> have been taken up by him, as in diſcourſe they fell from us: Fourthly, becauſe it is believed by many, that there is ſo much ſtrength in the <hi>Examinations,</hi> or weakneſſe in us, that we cannot anſwer them: Fifthly, becauſe the <hi>Examinations</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified in Pulpits: Laſtly, becauſe the <hi>Perſon</hi> whom we moſt eyed to have vindicated the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Aſſertions</hi> built upon them, we heare, is called away out of the kingdome. Hereupon we came to ſet upon the Work. And our requeſt (good Reader) is this, that the plainneſſe of the ſtyle may be paſſed over, and all weakneſſe in expreſſion; and if there be any ſtrength of Argument, that it be kindly accepted <hi>for the truths ſake.</hi> We profeſſe to be friends to the <hi>Truth,</hi> ſo farre as we know it, and ſhall think it the worſt work that ever we did in our lives; if we ſhould make any to erre from the <hi>Truth.</hi> We intreat God, as we are able, to <hi>lead</hi> both <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>us into all truth.</hi>

                  </label> and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them into a Chriſtian Church, while yet the Jewiſh Church was not diſſolved: for they ceaſed not to be a Church of God, till the body of them pertinaciouſly and deſperatly rejected Chriſt: Therefore they preached to the Jewes firſt, and thought themſelves bound ſo to doe, becauſe they were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113298:73"/>the people of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.19. &amp; 13.46. And yet they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome to ſeparate from the reſt (as your ſelfe acknowledge) <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. And their communion they had with them in Jewiſh worſhips, ſhews that they counted them a true Church. And ſome think, that their Church ſtate ceaſed not while their Temple ſtood. And yet before that time, many Jewes were gathered into many Chriſtian Churches, as both the Acts of the Apoſtles, and their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles doe declare. And if they might gather out of one Church, they might as lawfully have gathered out of twenty, or an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, had there been ſo many at that time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the Apoſtles never taught nor practiſed ſuch a thing, what warrant then have our brethren for their Presbyterian Church, which is gathered out of many Churches? For they In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> of a Presbyterian Church, which conſiſts of the Elders of many Churches.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, why may not one Church be gathered of the members of many Churches, as well as many Churches conſiſt of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one Church? For we read that the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſcattered upon <hi>Stevens</hi> perſecution, and we read not that they returned again, but fell into memberſhip with other Churches, (as is probable) which were planted in ſeverall parts of the world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſuch a Church which conſiſts of the members of many other true Churches, hath formerly been without exception in the dayes of the Prelates; how comes it now to be queſtioned? For at leaſt fourteen yeares ſince, ſuch a Church was extant in <hi>Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>all</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> (the vocall covenant being onely wanting) which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of the choyceſt Chriſtians of many Pariſhes, who met con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly together upon the Lords day, and enjoyed the Word, and Seales of the Covenant, and maintained a Paſtor to diſpenſe the ſame unto them, and never, or very rarely repaired to ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes where their habitations were. And we think it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but Mr. <hi>John Angiers</hi> Church at <hi>Denton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> hath of long time been ſuch, and many other ſuch there have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. And it was accounted an high happineſſe to have liberty to make ſuch a Church; but was never accounted by the godly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full before.</p>
               <p>But if you ſhould anſwer, <hi>That the Church conſiſts of ſuch as lived within ſuch a Pariſh, or Chappell, and that the reſt were ſtrangers:</hi> We
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113298:73"/>reply, If aſſembling conſtantly together, and participating in all the Ordinances that the reſt doe partake of, and contributing with the reſt in the maintenance of the Miniſter of ſuch a place, and an adhering rather to ſuch a Miniſter and people, then to any other in affection and action; if all theſe together make members of a Church, then theſe perſons of other Pariſhes were not ſtrangers, but members, and with the reſt made ſuch Churches; except it ſhall be ſaid, that habitation alone in other Pariſhes, when all the other are wanting, makes memberſhip, and conſtitutes Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which ſome of our brethren (who are Presbyterians) have and doe deny.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, are not ſome Pariſh Churches conſtituted ſometimes of members of other Pariſh Churches, when many perſons have left their own places, and removed into other Pariſhes without any conſent? Yet this hath been judged pious, at leaſt honeſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon one ground, and ſomtimes upon another, ſome to have liberty of conſcience in ſuch places whither they have removed; others to have better preaching; others to meet with better ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and others for better worldly accommodation: What Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian knoweth not well that this hath been common?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, that a Church may conſiſt of perſons that have been members of other Churches, if ſuch perſons have been orderly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed from ſuch Churches, and have come away with conſent, will be granted of all: For none hold Church-memberſhip to be undiſſolveable. The queſtion then will be, Whether the members of Churches may depart without conſent? 1. According to the preſent conſtitution of Churches, they may: For they come in without conſent, meerly by removing their habitations; therefore they may ſo depart. 2. If conſent muſt be had, from whom muſt it be ſought? From the people, or from the Miniſter? That the people have any power either to give or with-hold their conſent, hath not been granted heretofore: That the Miniſters conſent ſhould be neceſſary for the departing of every member, when yet himſelfe (it may be) hath had his entrance amongſt them, without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſeemes to be unreaſonable. 3. Suppoſe conſent hath been ſought, and cannot be obtained, may not members withdraw their memberſhip in ſome caſes without conſent? Suppoſe ſome Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance be corruptly diſpenſed, without all hope of redreſſe, and that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113298:6"/>men muſt partake therein without having any power ſo much as to witneſſe againſt ſuch corruptions, unleſſe they will be accounted factious, and diſturbers of the Churches peace; or that by remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning where ſuch corruptions are, they be in danger to be leavened with the corrupt lump of ſuch a Church of which they be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.6.</note> what muſt they now doe? Doth not that Rule that bids a Church purge out one perſon that may endanger the leavening of the whole lump, (when there are no other means to prevent ſuch an evill) give warrant to every member that is endangered to be leavened by the lump, to withdraw from ſuch a lump, (becauſe power to purge out the lump they have none) when there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means to prevent the evill?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.10.</note> Church memberſhip is for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the members, not for deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you ſtumble at this, becauſe they converted them not.</hi> To which we reply, Perſons whom the Apoſtles converted, were ordinarily committed to others to be further edified, and the ordinary Paſtors and Elders of the primitive times, did almoſt perpetually build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on anothers foundation. The perſons that watered for the moſt part, were not the ſame that planted. In <hi>Acts</hi> 11.20, 21. we read of a great converſion wrought by the preaching of the ſcattered Diſciples, but we read not that they were gathered into Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, till <hi>Barnabas</hi> was ſent unto them; and both <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> aſſembled with that Church and taught it, which yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted not. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.1, 9. <hi>Paul</hi> found twelve Diſciples (converted to his hand, though not fully inſtructed) and gathered them into the Church which he planted at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> But (Brother) how comes this to be a ſtone to ſtumble at? If you hold a ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Paſtors in the ſame Church, the ſucceſſors may feed a flock which their predeceſſors converted, and not themſelves. And if you hold tranſplantation of members from one Church to another, then they may feed the members which were of other Churches, which themſelves converted not.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <hi>This muſt be orderly done, and with conſent. Anſw.</hi> No ſuch order can be expected, where no ſuch order hath been wont to be exerciſed. If any godly perſon hath removed from one Countrey to another, and planted himſelfe in <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> have the Miniſters or people whom he left, ſent after him, or challenged him as theirs? Or have the Miniſters or people whom he hath
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113298:6"/>come to, rejected him, as none of theirs, becauſe not orderly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into their hands? Suppoſe the end of his removall was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a better people, or better miniſtery, Doth this make it the worſe, or more unwarrantable? Is it lawfull to remove to a fatter ſoile, when the place a man lives in, is more barren? Is it lawfull to remove to a purer aire, when the aire one hath lived in, is worſe, and diſtempers the body? And is it not lawfull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to a purer Church? The purer any Church is, doth not Chriſt take the more delight in it? And doth he not deſire to be there moſt? And why may not perſons deſire to plant themſelves where Chriſt gives moſt of his preſence? And if one man may u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite to ſuch a Church that is purer, may not many agree together to make ſuch a Church that may be purer? And this is all the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Churches that we know of, that is either taught or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed.</p>
               <p>But the exception is, That <hi>there is a removall of perſons to other Churches, without the removall of their habitations.</hi> But why ſhould this be blamed? 1. If diſtinction of Pariſhes by bounds and limits, be not <hi>Jure divino,</hi> where is then the fault?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Selden</hi> of Tithes.</note> 2. Was there not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty within this very Kingdome fromerly, for perſons to pay their tythes to what Miniſter they pleaſed? And conſequently, they were not tied to the Pariſh they lived in, but might chuſe their own ſociety and Paſtor (and hence it is, that there are ſome pieces of Pariſhes in ſome places ſix or eight miles diſtant from other parts of it, and whole Pariſhes betwixt.) Why therefore now ſhould there be an abridgement? 3. There are many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both to Miniſter and people, ariſing hence: 1. The Paſtors of Pariſh Churches are onely at certainty what houſes they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Miniſtery, not what perſons: for they may goe which way they will leaving their houſes, but their houſes and lands are ſixed, and they ſhall alwayes find them there. 2. The members of theſe Churches, though they have been bred up under the wing of ſuch Churches and Paſtors thereof, and have taken a love and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the ſame, yet if they remove from their habitation but a ſtones caſt ſometimes, they muſt be broken off thereby from ſuch Churches in point of Memberſhip. 3. A mans habitation may be neerer to ſome Church that is out of that pariſh, and ſo far off from his own Pariſh Church that he cannot conveniently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113298:7"/>thereunto, muſt he yet be bound to his own Pariſh Church by his habitation? 4. Suppoſe a man have many houſes in ſeverall Pariſhes, and would deſire ſometimes to live in one, and ſometimes in another, muſt he needs alter his Church memberſhip as oft as he changeth his habitation? Or can he be a member in all the Pariſhes where he hath houſes?</p>

                  </label> New-England Churches, and the Parliament together: For 1. The Parliament challengeth not the execution of Eccleſiaſtical cenſure, and yet can tell how to puniſh malignancie in Miniſters or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. 2. The Biſhops have laid claim to it, and exerciſed it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113298:7"/>any juſt or true title to it. Therefore though godly non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable Miniſters, might in prudence give place to violence (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when their people deſerted them, and Pulpit doores were ſhut againſt them,) yet in conſcience, and in obedience to ſuch ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions and depoſitions, they neither did (neither ought to have done) deſiſt from the execution of their office. 3. Miniſters that are cenſured by a lawful power, where ever it lies (whether in their own Congregationall Churches, or in a Presbytery (for we will not diſpute that now in this place) whether the cenſure be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted juſtly or unjuſtly,) ought to ſubmit thereto, and forbeare the execution of their Miniſtery in that place, till they be reſtored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; elſe Eccleſiaſticall government, which is Chriſts ordinance in the Church, (as Civill government is in the Common-wealth,) might come to be undermined and ſubverted by pretence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe in the managing of it, or the peace of the Church be diſturbed.</p>
               <p>But wherein makes this againſt the Poſition? We conceive that thoſe very Paſtors and Teachers of the Primitive Churches, which continued to preach, though the expreſſe command of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Magiſtrate was againſt it, leſt they ſhould offend Chriſt by deſiſting, were yet taken off from preaching when ſilenced by their own Churches, and that upon the ſame ground, leſt they ſhould offend Chriſt in perſiſting. But you goe on to ſay:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Had you ſuch an immediate commiſſion ſealed from Heaven,</hi>

                  <hi>and ſuch infallible direction of the Holy Ghoſt, as the Apoſtles had, you might more boldly imitate them therein; eſpecially if the caſe of living under a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate intending, endeavouring and conſuſting with Divines, about the Reformation of the Church, and of living under a Heathen Magiſtrate, were not much different.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The warrantablenes ariſeth not from the immediatneſſe of the Commiſſion, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reply. </seg>
                  </label> but from the truth and reality of it. If a Commiſſion be as really ſealed by Chriſt, and from heaven, thought not ſo immediatly as the Apoſtles was, yet it binds as truly to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the work of it, (till it be called in,) as the immediate doth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We allow the caſe to be much different: For when we live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, inteuding and endeavouring Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, we are raiſed up unto an expectation of having all the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113298:8"/>wayes of Chriſt countenanced and confirmed by his authoritie, (which would be a very bleſſed thing) which we have no ſuch ground to look for living under a Heathen Magiſtrate. But how the caſe is different in your ſenſe, we underſtand not: For the Chriſtianity of the Magiſtrate, or his piety and ſedulity, in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and endeavouring Reformation, cannot take any perſon or perſons off from their dutie, which they would be bound unto, if a Heathen Magiſtrate bore ſway. The Magiſtrate and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the people, muſt each doe their part, becauſe each ſtands engaged for himſelfe to Jeſus Chriſt, unto the work of his own place. The impediments that come from any unto other, cannot be a diſcharge unto any.</p>

It may be laid in ſeven or eight, and may grow up to an hundred, or a thouſand, or to as many as can meet together conſtantly unto edification in one place. The Church in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, was the ſame which was in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of all his ſonnes, and in the Families of their children after them, &amp; which afterwards grew up into a nation. And though the Goſpel Church is not now Nationall, as the Jewiſh was, yet a congregation of many Families may ſpring out of a Church of one Family, more eaſily then a Nation did formerly. And if ſeven, eight, or twelve may not make a congregationall Church in our apprehenſion, what have you been conſuting all this while?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ſeven or eight may make a Church,</hi>

                  <hi>then two hundred perſons in a Citie may well make twenty diſtinct Churches, and by conſequence ſo many Independent Judieatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, this collection is made to bring an <hi>Odium</hi> upon congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113298:10"/>Churches; but it may be thus retorted, foure or five in a houſe may make a family, therefore three hundred in an houſe may make ſixtie diſtinct families. Foure or five in a family may make a Domeſtick Church (ſay you,) then three hundred in a family may make ſixty Domeſtick Churches; two thouſand in a Field may make an Army, therefore two hundred thouſand in a Field, may make ten diſtinct Armies under ſo many independent Generals.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we have declared our ſelves before, that ſeven or eight may make a Church in the firſt foundation, and whilſt there are no more perſons fitted and that as more in that place ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, the Church, of them, is to be increaſed. And we are utterly againſt the unneceſſary multiplication of Churches, as conceiving ſuch ſmall Churches inconſiſtent to Chriſts ends, which is edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Paſtors, Teachers, Ruling Elders, Deacons, which he hath given to his Church. But that a Church of ſeven or eight ſhould require ſo many Officers, or be able to maintain them, we cannot underſtand. And we perceive from the patternes preſented in the New Teſtament, that Churches in cities which at firſt were ſmall, grew great by the daily addition of others to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.14.15. with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. &amp; 19.7, 8, 9, with 18, 19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17.28. So that we would not have beleevers of one citie, be of ſo many Churches, if one congregation will conveniently hold them, except there be ſome eminent reaſon for it. But though there ſhould be many Churches conſiſting of a few members: yet without Officers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, we doe not aſſert them to be Independent Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

And if believers in cities, meeting in divers places, are yet but one church, for this reaſon, becauſe they were of one city (as you would ſeem to inferre,) then ſhew but any probable reaſon, why believers meeting in divers places in countries, may not be one church, becauſe they were of one countrey, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the believers of <hi>Judea</hi> being but a ſmall countrey, and under the ſame civil government. The reaſon why city and church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound one another was this, becauſe there was not more converted in a city then could meet together in a congregation or church. And when you can ſhew us out of the new Teſtament that believers were ſo multiplied in any city, as that they could not all meet in one place, then will we ſhew you, that ſuch churches were divided into more churches.</p>

This would have been a more naturall expoſition.</p>
               <p>But we ſhall declare the Apoſtles naked ſcope, as we underſtand it.

Therefore in both his Epiſtles hee mentioneth the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> as the proper ſubject thereof; but the <hi>Achaians</hi> he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth but in one, and the Saints every where in another.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113298:13"/>place call on the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> as it were on the bye. And this is <hi>Pareus</hi> his expoſition upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. and he takes occaſion of confuting the vain conceit of <hi>Pighius</hi> and other Jeſuits, becauſe they would have <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles to extend to the particular uſes of thoſe times, and not to Saints in all places and ages.</p>

If in any proper manner of ſpeaking you will have the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian church nationall, meaning by <hi>nationall,</hi> the Saints that live within ſuch a nation, as diſtinguiſhed from the Saints of another nation, in countrey and place of habitation, without any othertie amongſt them, being all of them parts only of the Myſticall or Catholique church (as wee know the Sea that waſheth the Britiſh ſhores is called the Britiſh Sea, and that which waſheth the Belgick ſhores, is called the Belgick Sea, though they be not diſtinct Seas, but parts of the great Ocean; yet in reference to an adjunct of place they run by, they receive diſtinct denominations, and by a <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,</hi> the parts carry the names of the whole:) in this ſenſe we do yeeld the expoſition or phraſe of nationall church. But if you mean by nationall church, an inſtituted church of nationall extent in point of power and juriſdiction, upon which particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations within that nation do depend; wee want light, that there is, or ought to be any ſuch church in the times of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>For, if there ought to be ſuch a nationall church, (for patterns we have none, as your ſelf do confeſſe) then in this church there muſt be ſome nationall combination, nationall place for conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nationall Paſtor upon which it muſt depend, and nationall Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
               <p>For, ſeeing there was no ſuch church extant, when the Goſpel was written, nor rules left (for you would have alledg'd them (we ſuppoſe) had there been any) how all things muſt be carried in ſuch a nationall church, what reaſon can be ſhewed (if ſuch a church muſt be) why there ſhould be a departing from the pattern of the nationall church among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> in which they had all theſe things?

               </p>
               <p>Or, if you will have another modell of this <hi>nationall church</hi> of your owne framing, <hi>viz.</hi> a nation of Aſſemblies combined together, and repreſented in their officers, meeting <hi>in one place,</hi> and conſulting the good of the whole, and executing authority over the whole, then theſe perſons muſt ſtand in relation to all and each one of the Aſſemblies of the Nation under their juriſdiction; and ſo they are <hi>Nationall Officers</hi> every one of them, and the whole is the <hi>flock</hi> of each amongſt them, and each of them hath as full power over the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113298:15"/>aſſemblies that he never ſaw, as over that from which he came, and which ſent him; (as in the repreſentative civill body every <hi>Knight</hi> and <hi>Buegeſſe</hi> hath the care of the kingdome upon him, and each hath equall authority of inſpection and deciſion of matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning cities and countries, which hee knowes not, as of thoſe whence hee came.) Now if it be ſo, the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther each be not a Paſſor to every purpoſe, as well as unto one? And whether hee be not to feed by doctrine, as well as by the rod of diſcipline, all ſuch aſſemblies which are under his charge? (Which thing is yet impoſſible to be done.) And what warrant there is of <hi>non-reſidencie</hi> with the flock unto purpoſes that do moſt concern the flock, ſeeing themſelves are Chriſts Miniſters and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, and have not power of appointing Miniſters and ſubſtitutes under them; and what ground there is, why they muſt joyntly <hi>rule all the aſſemblies, but</hi> ſeverally <hi>teach</hi> each man the <hi>congregation</hi> to which he is <hi>deſigned,</hi> without care of the reſt?</p>
               <p>Or, if there be any ſuch combination of aſſemblies in a Nation, what is there to warrant it more, then the combination of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian aſſemblies in the world, repreſented in an <hi>oecumenicall councell,</hi> the members of which muſt be <hi>univerſall Paſtors,</hi> having <hi>power</hi> over, and <hi>care</hi> of all churches under them? For, if a <hi>Congregationall church</hi> muſt depend upon a <hi>Nationall church,</hi> as the leſſer upon the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then a <hi>Nationall church</hi> muſt depend upon the <hi>univerſall,</hi> as the leſſer upon the greater.

               <p>Beſides, is your ſcope to confound and loſe your Readers in the various acceptions of the word <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> or <hi>Church;</hi> ſo that when they reade the word <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi> they ſhall not be able to know what to make of it?

It had been your part to have taken your Reader by the hand, and to have ſhewed him when the word <hi>Church</hi> is taken properly, and when impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly.</p>
               <p>Both you in your <hi>Nationall,</hi> and wee in our <hi>Congregationall,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a people <hi>combined</hi> together into one body to worſhip God.

               <p>Furthermore, wee do not know, that <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Flock,</hi> or <hi>Lump,</hi> or <hi>Body,</hi> when referred to God and Chriſt, and is properly taken, is uſed otherwiſe then in two or three ſenſes: either for the <hi>myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Church, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.25, 26. or the<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 8.1.19.</note>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113298:18"/>of ſome perſons, and the churches in their Families, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if ſome other reaſon had not moved him; either then theſe Families were large and great Families, and might be as numerous as ſome <hi>Congregationall</hi> Churches; or the foundation of a Church might be laid in the perſons of a Family, but not ſo to continue, but to grow to a Congregation; or elſe ſome <hi>Congregationall</hi> Church might meet in ſuch houſes, which was ordinary in thoſe dayes.

               <p>Here is a deep <hi>charge</hi> of ſome things practiſed by us, <label type="milestone">

               <p>We anſwer for our ſelves:</p>
               <p>Firſt, there are ſome things fathered upon us, which we hold not: as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there muſt be ſome further declaration beſides profeſſion of faith and repentance.</hi> We contend for no ſuch thing, but conceive <hi>profeſſion of faith and repentance,</hi> if in the judgement of charity it may be <hi>accounted reall,</hi> if there be any thing that may ſerve to give witneſſe unto it, that it is <hi>not meerly verball,</hi> may be judged ſufficient.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the want of care to try the ſincerity and ſanctity of men, doth nullifie the Church;</hi> This is an opinion which we renounce as none of ours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That we muſt know that a Church was conſtituted of viſible Saints before we can in faith joyn to it.</hi> We hold flatly againſt ſuch an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and do believe a judgement may be made from the preſent faith and order which any Church holds forth, whether it be ſafe or unſafe to <hi>joyn</hi> to it, or to <hi>continue</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there are other things which ſome Churches hold and practiſe, which we think cannot be condemned: As that a Church muſt <hi>examine</hi> perſons that come to be admitted, whether <hi>the work
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113298:21"/>of grace</hi> be wrought within them or not. <hi>Your ſelf</hi> will now admit none (of whom you doubt) to the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> till you have firſt <hi>examined</hi> them of their <hi>knowledge;</hi> and why may not we <hi>examine</hi> them of their <hi>grace?</hi> Is the <hi>Lords body</hi> diſcerned by <hi>knowledge</hi> moſt, or by <hi>grace? Faith</hi> is a <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> is the beſt diſcerner of the <hi>Lords body;</hi> and if we can but finde <hi>grace,</hi> we ſhall be ſure to finde <hi>knowledge:</hi> The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Let a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelf;</hi> yet you think not that ſufficient, unleſſe you <hi>examine</hi> him; if it be <hi>no Scripturall way to examine others,</hi> why will <hi>you be ſo ſooliſh, prophane, preſumptuous, ſuperſtitious?</hi> A ſtranger comes to the gate of a <hi>Garriſon</hi> town, <hi>profeſſeth</hi> to be a friend, yet except there be ſomething to <hi>witneſſe</hi> the truth of that <hi>profeſſion,</hi> he is <hi>examined</hi> over and over again; and it is <hi>ſtrictneſſe</hi> that ſhewes <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> to the <hi>State:</hi> And ſhall we be more remiſſe and careleſſe when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive perſons into the <hi>Church,</hi> then we are when we receive them into a <hi>town?</hi> Our too much <hi>credulity</hi> may ſhew too little <hi>fidelity</hi> in the matters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well as in the buſineſſe of <hi>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, if the <hi>Church</hi> be not a common receptacle of all perſons, but that it conſiſt of a <hi>ſelected</hi> number, and ſome are received, and others rejected, then there are certain <hi>rules of reception and rejection.</hi> And then there muſt be a <hi>triall</hi> made by ſome, whether perſons be qualified according to thoſe <hi>rules;</hi> and this the light of <hi>nature</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, and the <hi>rules</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> lead to it; though there ſhould be nothing in the <hi>Scripture</hi> expreſly mentioning it. The moſt ſutable <hi>means</hi> ſerving moſt fitly to atchieve ſuch ends, are alwayes enjoyned in the <hi>ends,</hi> though they be not particularly expreſſed. But what think you? Is it not as lawfull to try perſons that would be <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members,</hi> and make ſome <hi>profeſſion</hi> in <hi>words</hi> of <hi>ſaith</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> but hold forth nothing which may probably give <hi>witneſſe</hi> to the <hi>reality</hi> thereof, as it was lawfull and commendable in the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to <hi>try falſe Apoſtles,</hi> which <hi>profeſſed in words</hi> to be <hi>true Apoſtles?</hi> Rev. 2.2. And is it not as reaſonable for a <hi>Church</hi> to ſeek ſatisfaction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reality and ſincerity of <hi>ſanctity</hi> from perſons of whom they doubt, as it was juſt and equall for the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſeek ſatisfaction concerning <hi>Saul,</hi> whether he were a Diſciple in <hi>truth</hi> or in <hi>pretence</hi> only? <hi>Acts</hi> 9.26, 27.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, there was cauſe of ſuſpicion and jealouſie in them, concerning him, becauſe they knew him formerly to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of the Church.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:113298:21"/>
               <p> And may not we ſay, there is cauſe of jealouſie, when we know externall profeſſion of faith and repentance to be ſo <hi>common,</hi> and the fruits which are worthy of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8. to be ſo <hi>rare</hi> and ſcarce to be found?</p>

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>end</hi> of Church-fellowſhip is not <hi>converſion,</hi> but <hi>edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Epheſ. 4.11, 12. Acts 9.31.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113298:22"/>Turks, Heathens,</hi> becauſe they may attain one <hi>end</hi> whereto it ſerves. It is ſuppoſed then that the perſons that enter into the <hi>Church</hi> are converted already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Excommunication</hi> is an ordinance in the <hi>Church,</hi> and one <hi>end</hi> of it is, to recover perſons that are deſperately <hi>ſick,</hi> and <hi>ready to die;</hi> it is in the uſe of it as <hi>phyſick,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. and therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the perſons to whom applied to be <hi>alive,</hi> therefore all <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members</hi> are to be reputed in the judgement of charity, to be <hi>living ſtones,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.</p>

               <p>Now to give better ſatisfaction, both of our opinion and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:113298:34"/>practice, we ſhall diſcover our preſent apprehenſions: thus,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We do apprehend <hi>tythes</hi> to be <hi>Jewiſh maintenance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Jo.

               <p n="2">2. Neither do we ſee ground for <hi>ſettled, ſlinted maintenance</hi> to laſt from yeere to yeer, if it muſt ariſe from the <hi>Church,</hi> and not come from the <hi>ſtate,</hi> as in ſome countries it doth; becauſe, if the <hi>Church muſt maintain the Miniſtery among them, as God bleſſed them</hi> (and a more equall rule then that, there can none be found;) then except they could <hi>ſettle Gods bleſſing,</hi> and make it to abide with men in an equall manner, <hi>without increaſe or decreaſe</hi> the <hi>maintenance</hi> may <hi>not be ſettled;</hi> and this alſo is an argument againſt <hi>tythes:</hi> There is a great inequality in <hi>tythes,</hi> and in all <hi>ſettled maintenance,</hi> if not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe;</hi> perſons whoſe eſtates ariſe from <hi>trading,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in goods (not having any lands) in ſome places <hi>pay nothing</hi> to the <hi>Miniſtery out of duty,</hi> and ſo the countrey maintains the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of the town, though many Chappels, perhaps, be robbed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, (we give inſtance in <hi>Mancheſter</hi>) whereas the towne is far more able to maintain their own <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> and the countries alſo round about them; and perſons who are much <hi>poorer</hi> in eſtate then others, but have <hi>larger</hi> lands then they, though others (<hi>leſſe</hi> in lands) can <hi>buy them</hi> twice or thrice over; yet <hi>pay more,</hi> becauſe of their <hi>lands</hi> then they: and if houſes be rated, or mens preſent eſtate valued, and maintenance ſetled in the juſt proportion; yet becauſe mens <hi>eſtates</hi> are like the <hi>Moon,</hi> in the increaſe ſome of them, and others of them like it in the decreaſe, it will ſoon grow unto an inequality again; Beſides, mens <hi>eſtates</hi> lie many times where their perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite not, neither can inhabite; and then their <hi>eſtates</hi> go to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>Miniſtery</hi> to which they do belong not, and they are ſo much the more diſabled in ſupporing the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> to which they do belong. And this <hi>ſetled viſible maintenance</hi> can be the <hi>mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> but of <hi>peaceable times,</hi> when the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and countenanceth <hi>Religion;</hi> for in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> dayes, and afterwards for three hundred yeers together, while the ten <hi>Perſecutions</hi> laſted, there <hi>neither was,</hi> nor could be on foot <hi>any ſuch maintenance.</hi> But

                  <hi>the Church treaſury duly kept up by contributions, according as God bleſſeth every man,</hi> will afford <hi>maintenance</hi> while the <hi>Church</hi> hath any thing, at all times; whether peaceable or troubleſome; whether the Magiſtatre be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or a <hi>Heathen.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. This <hi>maintenance</hi> out of the <hi>ſtock of the Church,</hi> we think we ſee moſt <hi>warrant</hi> for from the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> and as moſt probable we once diſputed it with you, and ſome other Brethren: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then, nor now, are we <hi>peremptory</hi> in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We conſidered <hi>how Chriſt and the Apoſtles were maintained</hi> in the work of the <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> and we finde that they had a <hi>Stock</hi> of monies, which came (partly at leaſt) by <hi>contribution,</hi> Luke 8.2, 3. and out of this <hi>ſtock</hi> was taken for the <hi>poor</hi> alſo, as from <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.29. appeares: ſee <hi>Junius</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We conſider what was done <hi>in the Apoſtles times,</hi> after <hi>Chriſt</hi> was taken from them, in the dayes of the firſt <hi>Chriſtian Church, Acts</hi> 2.45. &amp; 4.35. there was a <hi>ſtock</hi> then, but raiſed after an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> way, and yet by free <hi>contribution;</hi> they brought their whole eſtates, and put them into a <hi>common ſtock;</hi> which was but a temporary buſineſſe, and not <hi>aſtrictive</hi> unto all times. Now out of this <hi>common ſtock,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves, and all others that had need were maintained; and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had at firſt the overſight of this <hi>ſtock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.

So then the work was the ſame, which the <hi>Deacons</hi> managed, with that which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had before managed, only it was in other hands, the <hi>Deacons</hi> came into the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> place; hence it followes, that if the <hi>diſtribution was made as every one had need,</hi> when the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had the overſight, and if <hi>themſelves</hi> had a ſhare, as their need required, and <hi>other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers</hi> with them; then it was ſo afterwards, when the <hi>Deacons</hi> were intruſted in it; ſo then the <hi>Deacons</hi> Office was to <hi>receive</hi> into

               </p>

               <p n="1">1. We conceive all <hi>Officers</hi> are to have ſome maintenance; <hi>the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer is worthy of his hire;</hi> provided that he either require it, or the <hi>Church</hi> be able to give it.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. When the <hi>Church</hi> is not able to maintain her <hi>teaching Officers</hi> with an honourable maintenance; then if the <hi>ruling Officers</hi> and the <hi>Deacons</hi> will remit what ever reward from the <hi>Church</hi> their <hi>work</hi> calls for; 'tis <hi>no unrighteouſneſſe nor partiality</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>teaching Officers,</hi> and not the reſt; becauſe their <hi>works</hi> do not ſo require the whole man, but that they may have other Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to help themſelves, by which means they may ſpare the <hi>Church</hi> in her poverty, in point of maintenance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Your ſelf may do well to conſider whether the <hi>ruling Elders</hi> and the <hi>Deacons</hi> be maintained in the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Churches; and if it be an error not to do it, it is good to pull out that beam out of your own eye, and then you may ſee the better to take it out of your brothers eye.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Whileſt you ſay, that <hi>the Church in the firſt and primarie,</hi> &amp;c. I ſuppoſe your inference muſt be this; <hi>Ergo, thoſe words,</hi> Matth. 18. Tell the Church, <hi>cannot be rightly applied to a</hi> Congregationall Church, <hi>which hath no ſuch graduall judicatories and appeals; but</hi> Claſſicall, Provinciall, <hi>and</hi> Nationall <hi>Churches; for amongst theſe are found ſuch graduall judicatories and appeals.</hi> The ſinew and ſtrength of this reaſon is this: It is neceſſary that the <hi>judging Church</hi> in the times of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſhould <hi>anſwer</hi> in the manner of its judicature the <hi>judging Church</hi> in the time of the <hi>Law:</hi> and <hi>ergo,</hi> if <hi>that Church</hi> which was to <hi>judge then</hi> had graduall judicatories and appeals, ſuch ought to have the <hi>judging Church</hi> in the dayes of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> This main <hi>hypotheſis</hi> upon which the ſtrength of all depends, is unſound: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is <hi>neceſſary</hi> that the <hi>judging Church</hi> in the times of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſhould be <hi>conformed</hi> to ſpirituall <hi>precepts</hi> and <hi>patterns</hi> left us by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not appointed the <hi>Jewiſh church</hi> in matter of government to be a pattern to <hi>Goſpel Churches:</hi> For if ſo, then are not the Churches that are of <hi>Presbyterian complexion</hi> to be underſtood in this place, for there is a vaſt difference betwixt <hi>your</hi> Churches and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church: For,</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:113298:48"/>
               <p> Firſt, there is diſparity in the manner of the <hi>calling of perſons;</hi> for <hi>Synods</hi> are made up of men, choſen and ſent forth by particular <hi>Churches,</hi> but the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> did not conſiſt of choſen men ſent out by the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> but of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> which the <hi>Synagogues</hi> did neither chooſe nor ſend forth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is diſparity in matter of <hi>power:</hi> In the <hi>Jewiſh Sanhedrin</hi> the <hi>chief Prieſt</hi> was <hi>chief,</hi> by vertue of <hi>Office,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.11. but in the <hi>Claſſicall</hi> Way all are <hi>equall</hi> in point of <hi>Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of the <hi>cauſes judged:</hi> the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> dealt with matters of <hi>civill</hi> nature, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.5. but <hi>Synods</hi> only with <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, in reſpect of the <hi>time</hi> of judicature. The <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> was a ſtanding, conſtant court; but <hi>Claſſicall, Provinciall, Nationall</hi> and <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> Synods, meet but <hi>once in a moneth,</hi> once in <hi>half</hi> a <hi>yeer,</hi> once in <hi>twelve moneths;</hi> or it may be, not once in <hi>many ages</hi> is an <hi>Oecumenicall Synod</hi> gathered, and ſo thoſe appeals that are made from a <hi>Nationall,</hi> are in little hope to finde relief from an <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall</hi> Synod.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it were <hi>neceſſary</hi> that <hi>Church-government</hi> in the times of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſhould beare conformity with the <hi>Jewiſh Government,</hi> then they muſt not <hi>only</hi> have graduall <hi>judicatories</hi> and <hi>appeals,</hi> but they muſt have,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>a ſtated Oecumenicall judicature,</hi> conſtantly to judge all hard controverſies between blood and blood, plea and plea, ſtroke and ſtroke, into all Churches in the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>that this ſtated Oecumenicall judicature</hi> muſt have ſome <hi>ſtated place</hi> which <hi>God</hi> ſhould <hi>chooſe, Deut.</hi> 17.8. that ſo appellants might know whither to repaire for redreſſe of their grievances.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that there muſt be <hi>one chief by vertue of office</hi> over all met in this <hi>univerſall court,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.4. That he that ſhall do preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, and will not hearken to that <hi>Catholike councell,</hi> that man muſt die, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There may be good reaſon rendered, why the <hi>Synagogues</hi> ſhould be under a <hi>Juperiour judicatory;</hi> and the ſame cauſe there is why <hi>Congregationall-churches</hi> ſhould be under a <hi>Superiour judicatory.</hi> The <hi>Synagogues</hi> were <hi>parts</hi> of a <hi>church</hi> that had <hi>not power</hi> to diſpence <hi>all</hi> Gods <hi>Ordinances</hi> amongſt themſelves, and were <hi>branches</hi> of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick <hi>Nationall-church,</hi> endued with <hi>power</hi> of government <hi>as Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall:</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:113298:49"/>The Promiſe and Covenant of God extended to the whole <hi>Nation.</hi> But there is no ſuch power of government left to <hi>every</hi> or to <hi>any</hi> Nation in the world; neither are particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>parts</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>Synagogues</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were, but they are <hi>entire,</hi> and <hi>compleat Churches;</hi> and may tranſact <hi>all</hi> Gods <hi>Ordinances,</hi> walking in truth, and peace amongſt themſelves, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>all</hi> Gods <hi>Ordinances</hi> could not be tranſacted, unleſſe a <hi>whole Nation</hi> were converted and brought into Church-ſociety.</p>

               <p n="2">2. It will follow, that <hi>Philadelphia</hi> was <hi>lukewarm</hi> with <hi>Laodicea, dead</hi> with <hi>Sardis;</hi> and of theſe two <hi>lukewarm, dead Churches,</hi> may be verified the <hi>Encomiaſticks</hi> of <hi>Epheſus, Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> with many ſuch conſequences. But if your meaning be, that the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> ſent to the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> in reſpect of that remore, and generall concernment, whereby it may be of uſe to all <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> is ſent together with the reſt of the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> to the ſeven <hi>Churches;</hi> This (though a truth) will afford no contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the making good of your charge againſt the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> being that which they deny not.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Why is the burthen laid only (though it might be laid chiefly) upon one Church, when as the reſt are guilty? I ſuppoſe the building upon which you lay the weight of this roof, is this: Theſe ſeven Churches were a <hi>combined Presbyterie,</hi> and therefore as the government, ſo the neglect thereof concernes all.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, we cannot chooſe upon this conſideration, but condole the ſad condition of <hi>Presbyterian Churches</hi> which is ſuch, <hi>if wicked men be ſuffered in any particular Congregation in the world, all the Churches in the world are guilty of it.</hi> The reaſon is, the ſame obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that lies upon a <hi>Claſſicall Church</hi> to reform the ſeverall <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations</hi> in the <hi>Claſſis,</hi> the ſame lies upon a <hi>Provinciall Church</hi> to reform the ſeverall <hi>Claſſis</hi> in the <hi>Province;</hi> and the ſame lies upon a <hi>Nationall Church</hi> to reform the ſeverall <hi>Provinciall Churches</hi> in the <hi>Nation;</hi> and the ſame lies upon the <hi>Oecumenicall Church</hi> to reform the ſeverall <hi>Nationall Churches</hi> in the world: and therefore, though all the inferiour <hi>Churches</hi> ſhould fail, yet the <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> is bound to ſee it reformed; and if the <hi>Oecumenicall</hi> fail, <hi>all in the line of Oecumenicall communion,</hi> that is to ſay, all <hi>Churches</hi> in any <hi>Nation</hi> in the world <hi>are guilty.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Texts</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. gives this charge: <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers to feed the Church of God, i.</hi> their charge extends to none of them beyond <hi>the flock over which they were made over-ſeers</hi> in the work of <hi>feeding;</hi> now whether there were more <hi>Congregations</hi> in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or but one, yet no <hi>Elder</hi> could then, or can now, <hi>feed</hi> any

               <p n="2">2. It is more then probable, that the <hi>flock</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was but one <hi>Congregation:</hi> Firſt, <hi>Epheſus</hi> was a City, and we do not reade of more <hi>Congregations</hi> of Saints conſtantly meeting for the worſhip of God in any City, then one: Secondly, we cannot think, but that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem, Corinth</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> were as numerous as <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and yet none of them were more then one <hi>Congregation,</hi> if we be bound to reſt upon the <hi>Holy Ghoſts</hi> own teſtimony, who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth that they ordinarily met in one place, as before was ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>The <hi>Text</hi> in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2. gives this charge: <hi>Feed the flock that is among you.</hi> Now, neither the <hi>Elders</hi> to whom he writes were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, nor the <hi>Saints</hi> whom they were to <hi>feed,</hi> but both the one and the other, ſcattered abroad through many countries, <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Galatia, Aſia,</hi> &amp;c. therefore <hi>flock</hi> in this <hi>Text,</hi> is to be taken in a figurative ſenſe, and diſtributively of neceſſity; and the charge of <hi>feeding the flock</hi> is to be limited by the words <hi>(among you.)</hi> And thus it muſt be underſtood, <hi>you Elders</hi> in <hi>Pontus, feed the flock among you;</hi> and <hi>you Elders</hi> in Galatia, <hi>feed the flock among you,</hi> and <hi>you El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in Aſia, <hi>feed the flock among you;</hi> and each of you in every place, <hi>feed the flock where you be,</hi> in each place.

                  <hi>(nor candid)</hi> by comparing things diſparate, you would caſt an abſurditie upon us, but it will light upon your ſelf. You argue from works of common Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto works of <hi>Office</hi> very improperly: As ſuppoſe the matter were thus laid down; The <hi>Parliament</hi> writes to the <hi>Colonels</hi> of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,</hi> to look well to, and rule and govern the ſouldiers and people that is amongſt them; an inference is drawn hence, the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels</hi> of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> are not to govern and rule the ſouldiery and people of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> for their charge is over the ſouldiery and people amongſt themſelves; this inference is good. But you to overthrow it, would bring ſuch an argument as this: The <hi>Colonels</hi> of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> muſt agree amongſt themſelves, muſt they not therefore agree with the <hi>Colonels</hi> of <hi>Cheſhire?</hi> The ſouldiers and people of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> muſt reſpect and honour their own <hi>Commanders,</hi> muſt they not therefore reſpect and honour the <hi>Commanders</hi> in other counties alſo? This is a weak argumentation to overthrow the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; the fallacy lieth in this, you would extend duties of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and office in ſuch manner as duties of love and reverence, and honour (which reſpect all men, all ſuperiours) are to be extended. Therefore, ſeeing that it is a <hi>feeding of office,</hi> and an <hi>authoritative
